# Drive for Show, Putt for Dough: PGA Tour Performance Analysis

This project explores how driving and putting statistics influence player success on the PGA Tour. We analyze key performance metrics to determine which factors are the best predictors of scoring, earnings, and overall ranking.

## Data & Method

### Datasets
- **PGA2022 (1).csv** — Main dataset with player stats for the 2022 PGA Tour season.
- **Drive for Show and Putt for Dough.xlsx** — Supplementary workbook used for calculations, charts, and intermediate analysis.

### Source
- Data sourced from official PGA Tour statistics.

### Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Excel and Python
- Correlation analysis and linear/multiple regression
- Evaluation of R² values to assess strength of prediction

## Visualizations & Final Findings

- Scatterplots and regression lines explore:
  - Driving Distance vs Fairway %
  - Proximity to Hole vs One-Putt %
  - Putting and Driving vs Avg Score, Money, and Points
- Visualizations created in Excel and included in the PowerPoint

See:
- PowerPoint presentation for annotated visual findings
- `Drive for Show and Putt for Dough.xlsx` for source charts

Key Findings:
- Putting metrics had a stronger correlation with scoring than driving metrics.
- Combining both in a multiple regression model slightly improves predictability.
- R² values suggest that no single stat fully explains success—performance is multifaceted.

## Conclusion

Success on the PGA Tour is not driven by one skill alone. While long drives help, accurate putting tends to have a greater impact on scoring. This project demonstrates how statistical analysis can guide player development and performance strategy.
